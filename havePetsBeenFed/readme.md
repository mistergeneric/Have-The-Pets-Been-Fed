# Have the Pets Been Fed

This is the lamdba for the Alexa skill I am making which will track whether or not someone in the house has fed the cat, or not.

## Installation

### Clone

Clone the repo here: https://github.com/mistergeneric/Have-The-Pets-Been-Fed.git

### Setup

If you'd like to test, you'll need an Alexa Developer Console account and either an Alexa hosted Lamdba or a Lambda hosted on AWS.

## Usage

This is intended to be a fully fledged Alexa Skill available soon!
